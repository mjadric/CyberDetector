6. Network Analysis Components
1. Basic Graph Theory Applications
Vulnerability Graphs: Model network vulnerabilities and their relationships as directed graphs, where nodes represent vulnerabilities and edges represent the connections or dependencies between them. This will help to visualize how vulnerabilities are connected across the network.
Attack Path Analysis: Use basic graph traversal techniques to identify potential attack paths between compromised nodes. This analysis can help understand how a malicious actor could navigate through the network once an entry point is established.
Centrality Metrics: Calculate basic centrality metrics (such as degree centrality and closeness centrality) to identify the most critical vulnerabilities in the network. These could be key points where the attack could have the largest impact.
2. Advanced Graph Theory Applications (Optional)
Vulnerability Graphs: Extend basic vulnerability graph models by adding more advanced features, such as incorporating metadata about the vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE data, exploitability, patch status) to improve the accuracy of the analysis.
Attack Path Analysis: Implement more sophisticated graph traversal algorithms, such as Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford, to identify the shortest or most effective attack paths in the network.
Centrality Metrics: Extend centrality metrics to include betweenness centrality, which measures the influence of a node over the spread of information in the network (critical for identifying attack chokepoints).
Community Detection: Use clustering or community detection algorithms (e.g., Louvain or Girvan-Newman algorithms) to detect groups of related vulnerabilities or attack paths. This can help in identifying areas of the network that are most susceptible to coordinated attacks.
Advanced Attack Path Analysis: Implement more complex pathfinding algorithms to analyze different attack paths and their potential impact on network security, helping to identify weak spots for mitigation.
